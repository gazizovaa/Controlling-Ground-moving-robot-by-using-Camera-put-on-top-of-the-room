<h2>Mobile Robot controlled with overhead camera in the room</h2>

<p>A robot has been designed to navigate within a room with the assistance of an overhead camera. The detection system installed in the robot consists of two colored circles and a cardboard. By analyzing the images captured by the camera, the system identifies the similarities between the circles. To ensure accurate movements, the robot utilizes a closed-loop control algorithm. Moreover, the system is capable of saving the coordinates for future reference and analysis.</p>
